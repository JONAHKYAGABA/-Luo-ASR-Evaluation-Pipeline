✅ What is the name and purpose of the project?
Name: Luo ASR Evaluation Pipeline

Purpose:
This project evaluates automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for the Luo language using the Hugging Face transformers library. It loads a test set from Hugging Face Hub (KYAGABA/Merged_Luo_Dataset_new), performs preprocessing and inference using Wav2Vec2BertForCTC models, and calculates WER and CER metrics. The results are saved in CSV format.

✅ Who is the intended audience or user of this project?
Researchers in speech recognition, especially those working with African or low-resource languages.

Developers and contributors building or benchmarking ASR models for local languages.

Language technologists and academic groups aiming to evaluate fine-tuned ASR models for underrepresented linguistic communities.
